What is Behaviour-driven Development?
Behaviour-driven Development (BDD) as a software development process is composed of multiple subtechniques. Under the hood, it combines Test Driven Development, which allows short feedback loops, with domain-driven design and object-oriented design and analysis. As a development process, it allows the stakeholders and the developers to enjoy the benefits of short feedback loops, writing just the right amount of code and design to make the software work. You can read more about BDD in our tutorial on Behavior-driven Development.

Introducing our Model
When we think of Rails models, we usually think of reflecting the problem domain for which we are providing a solution. Models can sometimes be full-blown objects with rich behaviour. Other times, they can be just simple data containers or data maps.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be creating a model called Auction. We will keep things simple â€” each auction will have only one item for sale. The Auction model will have an end date, item title, description of the item on sale, list of bids, seller and a winning bid.
